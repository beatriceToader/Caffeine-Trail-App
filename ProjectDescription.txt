Caffeine Trail is a mobile app that creates a contact between coffee lovers and the coffee shops around them. The users have access to the nearest coffee places based on their location. They can save their favorites for later and be redirected to Google Maps for directions. 

How does it work?
-> When you press the app icon you find the first page which tells you to "Get Started". Pressing the "Get Started" button you go to the Sign in page. 
-> In the Sign In page you enter your account data and if you don't have an account you can choose to Sign Up (you get redirected to another page)
-> After you are logged you get to a page where you have access to the map where you see your current location and the nearest coffee shops around you (the cafes are displayed as a list and also as pins on the map)
-> You can add one or more coffee shops to your favorites list (or remove it/them from the list) and access that list.
-> You also can be redirected to Google Maps in order to obtain the directions to one coffee shop.
